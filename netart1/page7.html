        <h1>People think I'm a fool for seeing music as my sure thing, but it's the only way out...</h1>
        <p>In the chaos, I found something that doesn't judge me, something that understands me without words. That explains what I feel and want to say to the world, but can't Music is the only thing that makes me feel alive when everything else seems to fade away..</p>
        <p>The melodies lift me up when I can't get up.</p>
